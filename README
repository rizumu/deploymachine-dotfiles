TECHNIQUE thx @rtomayko

My home directory is a real git work tree. The repository
data is stored in ~/.git. Some people like to keep the
actual work tree somewhere else and symlink files into
their home. I don't do that.

One issue with this approach is that 'git status' can be
overly noisy, since most files are not tracked and show up
as "other" files. I get around this by ignoring all files
that I haven't added explicitly -- this is as simple as
adding a "*" line to the ~/.git/info/exclude file.

Another issue is how best to handle machine specific or
sensitive information (usernames / passwords, API keys,
etc.) included in dotfiles. I simply do not add any files
to the repository unless they're "clean". In some cases,
that means not adding stuff that I'd otherwise like to
have tracked. For example, I'd like to publish my
~/.gitconfig file but it contains my secret github API
key.
